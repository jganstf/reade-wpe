## Notes
- the mobile menu bottom padding to account for scrolling is set when the button is clicked. In development, preventing the menu hide on load will make this functionality not works as intended. It is not an issue. Simply it requires following the desired UX flow.
- change the menu requires selector updates in the scss - search `.menu-item-`
